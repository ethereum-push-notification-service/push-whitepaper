# Game Theory

The game theory of governance is designed keeping in mind all participating users of the Push ecosystem. The more users the protocol has, more services will come leading to an increase in fees pool and rewards leading to direct impact on the token utility as the token is intrinsically linked to protocol growth, being a key medium of exchange for all activities occurring thereon.

## Game Theory

1. **Service Providers** ​are already incentivized to send notifications as it brings them on par with web2 experience, and with platform agnostic and incentivized notifications, we can even go ahead and state that Push betters the current notification game of web2 / centralized. The subsection of this will also be ​**vendors** ​who are third party developers that will be creating channels to capitalize on liquidity mining.
2. **Users**​ are incentivized as they want to receive notifications related to payments, DeFi, gaming or service​ ​on web 3. As can be seen by traditional services \(web 2\) and the rampant use of notifications to drive engagement which is working and has become a part of all of our daily lives. Users also benefit by ​**receiving token incentives from notifications** ​and by **universal delivery**​.
3. **Wallets / Infra Services**
   * **Existing Wallets / Services** ​are incentivized to continue performing as that ensures their perpetual share from the integration partners pool.
   * **Future Wallets** ​are incentivized to integrate with the growing reward pool of **EDP**, ​as​ ​it gets higher over time as more fee flows in the protocol \(as more and more notifications are sent\). This creates an incentive for future wallets to consider integration to protocol to claim this reward and also to move a proposal to have perpetual share in the Integration partners pool.
   * **Note:** ​The integration in turn drives more users to the protocol which drives more services and thus an increase in the fees pool which starts the cycle of future wallets integration again.
4. **Token Holders** ​are incentivized to keep and to pass the best proposal and keep core features fees competitive at the best rate possible as they gain the most of all the participating users are properly incentivized as it drives utility to the protocol and the usage of protocol.

**Example:**​ More users means more services want to integrate which drives up the fees present in the fees pool \(and in turn the integration partner pool and the reward pool\), this encourages more wallets to support the protocol which ensures more users in the ecosystem. We see the network effect to work on smaller wallets first and then bigger as the EDP funds start to increase due to the above scenario leading to bigger wallets considering integration and thus starting the cycle again.
