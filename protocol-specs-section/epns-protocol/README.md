# Push Protocol

## Introduction

Push Protocol is a decentralized communication protocol for Web3! Using which any dApps, smart contracts, backends or protocols can send communication (starting with on-chain / off-chain / gasless notifs) tied to user wallet addresses in an open, gasless, multichain, and platform agnostic fashion. The open communication layer allows any crypto wallet/front end to tap into the network and get the communication across.

In the future, the protocol can also support other blockchain by exploring bridging or migrating the contract and service to a particular blockchain.
