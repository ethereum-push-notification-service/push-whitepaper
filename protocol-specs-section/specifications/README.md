# Specifications

Push is a notification protocol at its heart. We see notifications as the means to communicate information which can be of different types, carry different utilities and perform different tasks as per their use cases. To enable this, we assign each notification payload a payload type that defines certain characteristics of both the data they carry and the medium of storage. 

Besides the flexibility of notification payload, we also see the rules established between **channels** and their **subscribers** to also have an impact on their utility and use cases.

Keeping in mind with the above analogies, the following specifications are rolled out to ensure that the specifications and the payload determine the use case of the notification rather than treating them as plain standard ones.

Some of the use cases we see opening up by this approach are:

* To allow users to receive notifications with different content type \(images, call to actions, videos, etc.\).
* To allow future content or payload to be different and be interpreted differently.
* Makes interpreting payload storage flexible as changing payload type can indicate the storage medium \(on-chain, IPFS, other storage solutions\).
* To allow service to create channel that any user can subscribe to.
* To allow channels to approve users as subscribers and create business cases around them.
* To allow channel and users to approve each other before information is shared between them.
