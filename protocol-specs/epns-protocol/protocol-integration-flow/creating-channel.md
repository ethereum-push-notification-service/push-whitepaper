# Creating Channel

The creation of channel is a **one time process** and as such is recommended to do it either from Push dApp, Push JS library or a custom JS library of your choice. [Information about the channel payload specs is described here](../../specifications/channel-payload-specs.md).

Interfacing directly via smart contract to protocol to create a channel can also be done by calling it

*  with **public key registry** function

```text
createChannelWithFeesAndPublicKey(bytes calldata _identity, bytes calldata _publickey) external
```

* without **public key registry** function

```text
createChannelWithFees(bytes calldata _identity)
```

| Parameter | Sub Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **\_identity** |  | The identity field consists of the following parameters joined together with a delimiter. |
|  | payloadtype | payload type not only indicates the content of notification but also the storage implementation stored. |
|  | payloadhash | Indicates the hash of the payload through which payload data can be obtained. |
| **\_publickey** |  | Pass the publickey of the wallet in bytes |

| payloadtype | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Represents storage on IPFS with letters Qm happen to correspond with the algorithm \(SHA-256\) and length \(32 bytes\) used by IPFS. |

{% hint style="info" %}
The delimiter **+** is used for joining the fields together, this is done to optimize the payload written on chain.

{% hint style="info" %}
Always recommended to interface with **Push JS Library** for abstracting these details out.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature of protocol might change for further optimizations in the future.
